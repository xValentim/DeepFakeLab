## üëΩ Creating vector feature

In here, we will calculate vector about atribute that we want insert. In this, we calculate Bald vector atribute and will insert in another images. The math about this trick is very simple! First, define your subset with True for your feature C, in another words: 


$$\mathcal{A}_{[C==1]} = \lbrace \phi(x) | x_c == 1 \rbrace$$

Where $\phi(x) = z \in \mathbb{R}^{32}$ (The encoder of my autoencoder). And, the same idea for instances that C is False:

$$\mathcal{B}_{[C==0]} = \lbrace \phi(x) | x_c == 0 \rbrace$$

In this context, we will undersample one of subsets to turn this sentence true:

$$ | \mathcal{A} | \sim | \mathcal{B} | $$

Then, we calculate two centroids, for each subsets: 

$$ Cm_{A} = \frac{\sum_{x \in \mathcal{A}} \phi(x)}{n(\mathcal{A})} $$

$$ Cm_{B} = \frac{\sum_{x \in \mathcal{B}} \phi(x)}{n(\mathcal{B})} $$

Finally, we can extract vector atribute:

$$\vec v = \vec Cm_{A} - \vec Cm_{B}$$

## üîÆ Insert feature

In this context, we already have a vector feature (yay!), so we can incorporate this feature using a simple mathematical operation:

$$FakeImage = \psi(\phi(x) + \sum_{i} t_i \cdot \vec v_i)$$

Where $x \in B$, $t \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\psi$ is decoder!

## Neural Networks Architectures 

Basically, we will use Convolutional Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Diffusion Models (DM). 

We explore another auxiliar loss functions using sobel filters to capture high frequency feature from images!

$$L_{sobel} = \gamma \cdot |f(I) - f(\psi(\phi(I)))|$$

where $f(I) = \sqrt{(G_x \ast I)^{2} + (G_y \ast I)^{2}}$, and $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}$.

So, if we using VAE architecture, our loss will be:

$$\mathcal{L} = L_{reconstruction} + \text{DKL} + \gamma \cdot L_{sobel}$$

$$\mathcal{L} = |I - \psi(\phi(I))|^{2} -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left(1 + \log(\sigma_i^2) - \mu_i^2 - \sigma_i^2\right) + \gamma \cdot |f(I) - f(\psi(\phi(I)))|$$

$$\mathcal{L} = |I - \psi(\phi(I))|^{2} + \mathbb{E}_{\phi(z | x)} \left[ \log \frac{\phi(z | x)}{\psi(z)} \right] + \gamma \cdot |f(I) - f(\psi(\phi(I)))|$$




(GAN and DM are still building... ‚åõ)

## Transitions beetween multiple instances

In this context, we will use a simple trick to create a transition between two instances. The idea is simple:

1. Calculate the vector encode for each instance: $\phi(x_1)$ and $\phi(x_2)$
2. Create a linear space between these two vectors: $\mathcal{L} = \lbrace \phi(x_1) + \alpha \cdot (\phi(x_2) - \phi(x_1)) | \alpha \in [0, 1] \rbrace$
3. Pick a subset of $\mathcal{L}$, denoted by $\mathcal{L}_{sub}$ and insert in decoder: $\psi(\mathcal{L}_{sub})$
4. Finally, we will have a transition between two (or more) instances!
